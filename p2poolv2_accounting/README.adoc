== Accounting for Standalone PPLNS Pool

This crate provides accounting for PPLNS pool and is used to
instantiate Hydrapool as a standalone PPLNS server.

If you want to try an alternate accounting approach, email us, we can
provide traits to help you do so. At the moment, we avoided making
things generic - cause we want to ship Hydrapool. Maybe we will
revisit this generalisation in the future.
